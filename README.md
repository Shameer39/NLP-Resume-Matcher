# NLP : Resume Matcher

This project is an AI-powered resume analysis tool built with Streamlit, leveraging Google Gemini through the google-generativeai library to evaluate resumes against job descriptions. Users upload their resume in PDF format, and the app extracts the text using PyPDF2, then generates either a professional summary of the resume or calculates a job match percentage with missing keywords, providing insights to improve alignment with specific roles.
